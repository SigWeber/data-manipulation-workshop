# Introduction

Data manipulation - or the process of cleaning, organising and preparing your data for further analysis - is required for most projects involving real-world datasets. This workshop teaches you how to use R to manipulate raw data and prepare it for analysis. We will cover the following topics:

* The grammar of data manipulation
* Merging multiple datasets
* Creating subsets of data using filters
* Reshaping data between long and wide formats
* Summarising data with group-wise operation
* Setting up data pipelines in dplyr for efficient data manipulation


The workshop is designed for individuals who are already familiar with R but wish to learn efficient techniques for data manipulation. Ideally, you bring your own laptop with the latest version of R and RStudio installed.
